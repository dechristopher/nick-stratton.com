					<h2>ASME SDC Project</h2>

					<h4>Background</h4>
					<p>The ASME-SDC (Student Design Competition) is a project hosted by ASME (American Society of
            Mechanical Engineers.) The competition was created to be held at the
             ASME E-Fest, which was an engineering festival which promised to let
             me "party like an engineer", with food, a concert and lots of interesting
             lightning talks from industry professionals. The robot was no party
						 to design, however. The competition was a robot pentathalon, which
						 meant that the robot had to complete 5 different tasks. The tasks
						 were the hit, the throw, the sprint, the climb, and the lift.
						 While we were there, we had a lot of fun, placed better than we
						 expected, and even learned a thing or two along the way.
					</p>
					<h4>The Design Process</h4>
					<p>The first step of this project was some intense brainstorming when
						the rules first came out. This took place over the course of months,
						 and honestly was cause for a lot of problems with the robot down the
						 road. When desigining the robot, we should have worked together in
						 our large group to design each portion together. Instead, we broke
						 into teams of 4 and each pushed to design a subsystem for the
						 robot. In theory, this allowed us to complete the robot much faster.
						 In reality, it discouraged communication between groups, which led
						 to oversights while designing, and led to an inferior robot.
					</p>
					<h4>Solidworks</h4>
					<p>Being a freshman coming from a prepratory high school, I had had 0
						previous CAD experience. Also, considering the project started early
						 into the fall semester, I didn't even have the chance to take the
						 introductory CAD CAM class offered at my school. Because of this, I
						 was forced to learn Solidworks by trial an error, asking upperclassman
						 questions and fiddling around with it every chance I got. through
						 a few iterations, I designed a scissor lift to complete lift
						 portion of the competition
					</p>
					<h4>Manufacturing</h4>
					<p>Manufacturing the SDC robot was my first experience working with
						aluminum. Today, working with aluminum isn't too worrisome, because
						I've realized it cuts incredibly easily. This project definitely
						taught me about the very basics of manufacturing, something I continue
						to learn about on both the ROV project and my Manufacturing 1000
						class.
