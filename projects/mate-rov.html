					<p>The MATE-ROV Project is hosted by MATE international. It
						is a competition to teach science, technology, engineering, and math
						 (STEM) and prepare students for technical careers. Wentworth IEEE
						 (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) is working on
						 a ROV to compete in the June International competition. I was named
						 the mechanical lead for this project, which meant that I was able
						 to work on the project while leading my peers in order to develop all the
						  mechanical designs for the ROV. This taught me valuable lessons in
							regards to how to effectively manage people, follow the design
							process, design for manufacturability, and is currently pushing my
							manufacturing ability to new levels.

					<h4>The Brainstorm</h4>
      <div class="row">
				<div class="description col-sm-4">
					<p>The first step of this project was some intense brainstorming when
						the project first came out. The rules were delayed, which put a strain
						on our already tight schedule. Being college students, we had all left
						campus during christmas time, which is about when the rules came out.
						Without being on campus for the first few weeks, almost no progress
						was made on brainstorming. Because of this, we had to compress our
						schedule to start in January. We made an agressive schedule and the
						Gantt Chart to match, and have done our best to stick to it. The
						schedule called for 3 weeks of design, 6 of manufacturing, a
						week and a half for testing, and 10 weeks for all the documentation
						mate requires us to submit, including creating the video of
						submission. We also scheduled 5 days into the Gantt Chart for
						the inevitable bumps in the road.

			<h4>Solidworks</h4>
	 <div class="row">
		 <div class="description col-sm-4">
			<p>The CAD is a crucial step for every engineering project, but one
				that my team actually ran into some trouble with. One of the hardest
				parts of engineering challenges like this, in my opinion, is knowing
				when to stop. An idea can be thought over, designed, redesigned,
				overdesigned, scrapped and reworked before anything is finalized.
				When this happens, you start to use valuable time inefficiently.
				I would say that one of the biggest challenges that we as a team faced
				was understanding when it was time to start manufacturing the ideas
				that we had so painstakingly created. Throwing those first chips
				was the hardest part. Now, we've started manufacturing lots of parts,
				and the ROV is coming together nicely.

					  <h4>My Contributions</h4>
			 <div class="row">
				 <div class="description col-sm-4">
					<p>As the mechanical lead, I was in charge of the
					  mechanical design of the ROV. I say that lightly, since I would never
						for a second say that all the mechanical designs were mine. They were
						a combination of a lot of hard work from a lot of different people.
						Nonetheless, I firmly believe that I made two valuable contributions
						to the team.
          </p>
           <p>
						One:
						I was nominated as the mechanical lead. When I was nominated I
						was adamant about saying that I was there to learn, just like every
						other student on the team. I chose times for meetings, held meetings,
						resolved interpersonal disputes among teammates, helped others when
						they needed help, and spear-headed the design of the general use
						manipulator.
					</p>
					<p>
					 Two:
					 I was also one of four students who did a lot of administrative work
					 in parallel to design, which mostly included hunting for and filling out
					 grant proposals in order to fund the project, which has grown to be quite expensive.
					 Through the hard work of the 4 of us, the project has the funds it will
					 need to succeed, and the students who made valuable contributions to
					 the team will be able to travel,	almost completely free.

					<h4>Manufacturing</h4>
				<div class="row">
				<div class="description col-sm-4">

					<p>Manufacturing the ROV has taught me a lot that I don't think I would
						ever get the chance to learn in my classes. While starting in on the
						manufacturing of the ROV, I learned how to make proper drawings from
						solidworks models, a skill taught to me in my Engineering Graphics
						course, and honed through this project. Also, it has taught me about
						 proper fits and tolerances, and design for manufacturablity, which
						 has given me a better understanding of my Manufacturing 1000 class.
					</p>

					<p>The ROV was made almost completely manually, something myself and
						Andrew Zucker, the main machinists, are incredibly
						proud of. Using only a prototrak mill and lathe each with a DRO,
						we were able to make some very complex parts, including ones
						that would be used as o ring surfaces, which requires much tighter
						tolerances and smoother surface finishes than most can
						achieve on a manual machine.
					</p>

					<p>Manufacturing for the ROV taught me a lot about proper tolerancing,
						what tolerancing is "good enough", and the importance of holding
						tolerance in machining. Multiple failures of the ROV could be attributed
						to using parts that were not within tolerance. This taught me about
						what tolerances were most critical and how to note that in a mechanical
						drawing. Fortunately, almost every tolerance on the ROV was within
						spec, which allowed it to work incredibly fluidly in water.
					</p>

         </div>
				 <h4>Testing</h4>
			 <div class="row">
			 <div class="description col-sm-4">

				 <p>Manufacturing the ROV is coming along nicely, and we are far enough
					 along that we are now able to conduct testing of the main chasis,
					 which included most of the electronics and the drive system, as well
					 as the seals that run along the chasis. A college nearby was gracious
					 enough to let us do some testing in their pool, and we got some interesting
					 results.
				 </p>
				 <p>We decided that the best course of action was to do a wet test without
					any electronics to start. That ended up being a very good decision,
					considering the ROV took on water. After opening it up and draining the water,
					the leak could have been from a few different places. The most likely
					source was the seal on the front lense, which dripped out water when
					removing the ROV from the pool. The other likely source was from
					non-uniform tightness of the screws in the screw pattern that runs along
					the O-ring. Without a torque wrench with us at the pool, some screws
					were found to be too loose, and others were so tight we couldn't get them
					out without stripping them. The front lense will be resealed before the
					next round of tests. Also, the stripped screws will be replaced and
					torqued down uniformly, which will hopefully fix the O-ring seal.
				 </p>

				 <p>Through some more testing, we were able to slowly find and seal more
					 and more leaks that were being found over the past few weeks. Thanks
					 to the testing in the manufacturing center, we were able to find and
					 seal all the leaks, and the robot is dry and able to do water testing.

				<h4>Competition</h4>
			<div class="row">
			<div class="description col-sm-4">

				<p>The rules of the conpetition state that teams must enter a submission
					video in order to qualify for international competition. The video outlined
					tasks that we had to complete and show to MATE in order to prove our
					ROV was capable of competing at the international level. The video was
					due May 11th, and the team spent the month before spending 12+ hours a
					day in our lab and all over the school, machining, wiring, troubleshooting,
					testing and hoping we wouldn't break anything. It took us over a week
					to completely seal the chassis, and over a week to slowly bring all
					the subsystems online and integrate them into the main chassis. With
					one week left, we had a few large scale failures in systems that led to
					sweeping redesigns and late night CAD sessions, early
					morning machining and testing at noon every day. Thursday the 10th rolled
					around and we were all nervous for we only had 3 hours total of testing
					time left at our local pool. Thursday was filled with electrical issues,
					and we had to push testing until the 11th, the last day. It was clear
					we would need more pool time than accessible in the city, so we planned
					to drive an hour and a half west to my hometown in order to use a
					community pool that was open longer.
				</p>

				<p> The entirety of the night of the 10th was used to solve electrical
					issues, which ended up being a combination of a short between ESC's and
					a burnt trace on the sensor board. At 5:30 am, 6 of us left for western
					mass to spend the day filming. Electrical issues continued to plague us,
					as well as realizing that precision movement was very hard to achieve
					with just one driver. We added a second controller to handle some of the
					degrees of movement, and with that change we were able to more precisely
					control the ROV. At around 7pm, we filmed a 15 minute, uncut submission
					video that we hoped was acceptable for MATE. By the time we filmed the
					rest of the required safety videos and drove home, it was 1 am and we
					hadn't slept in over 40 hours. But the video was submitted and our almost
					month long labor of love was ready for competition.
