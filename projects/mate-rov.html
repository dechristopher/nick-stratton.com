				<h2>MATE ROV Project</h2>
					<h4>Background</h4>
				<div class="description col-sm-4">
					<p>The MATE-ROV Projetc is a project hosted by MATE international. It
						is a competition to teach science, technology, engineering, and math
						 (STEM) and prepare students for technical careers. Wentworth IEEE
						 (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) is working on
						 a ROV to compete in the June International competition. I was named
						 the mechanical lead for this project, which meant that I was able
						 to work on the project while leading my peers in order to develop all the
						  mechanical designs for the ROV. This taught me valuable lessons in
							regards to how to effectively manage people, follow the design
							process, design for manufacturability, and is currently pushing my
							manufacturing ability to new levels.

					<h4>The Brainstorm</h4>
      <div class="row">
				<div class="description col-sm-4">
					<p>The first step of this project was some intense brainstorming when
						the project first came out. The rules were delayed, which put a strain
						on our already tight schedule. Being college students, we had all left
						campus during christmas time, which is about when the rules came out.
						Without being on campus for the first few weeks, almost no progress
						was made on brainstorming. Because of this, we had to compress our
						schedule to start in January. We made an agressive schedule and the
							Gantt Chart to match, and have done our best to stick to it. The
							schedule called for 3 weeks of design, 6 of manufacturing, a
							week and a half for testing, and 10 weeks for all the documentation
							mate requires us to submit, including creating the video of
							submission. We also scheduled 5 days into the Gantt Chart for
							the inevitable bumps in the road.

					  <h4>My Contributions</h4>
			 <div class="row">
				 <div class="description col-sm-4">
					<p>As the mechanical lead, I was *technically* in charge of the
					  mechanical design of the ROV. I say that lightly, since I would never
						for a second say that all the mechanical designs were mine. They were
						a combination of a lot of hard work from a lot of different people.
						Nonetheless, I firmly believe that I made two valuable of contributions
						to the team.
          </p>
           <p>
						One:
						I was nominated as the mechanical lead. When I was nominated I
						was adamant about saying that I was there to learn, just like every
						other student on the team. I choose times for meetings, held meetings,
						resolved interpersonal disputes among teammates, helped others when
						they needed help, and spear-headed the design of the general use
						manipulator.
					</p>
					<p>
					 Two:
					 I was also one of four students who did a lot of administrative work
					 in parallel to design, which mostly included hunting for and filling out
					 grants in order to fund the project, which has grown to be quite expensive.
					 Through the hard work of the 4 of us, the project has the funds it will
					 need to succeed, and the students who made valuable contributions to
					 the team will be able to travel,	almost completely free.

					<h4>Solidworks</h4>
			 <div class="row">
				 <div class="description col-sm-4">
					<p>The CAD is a crucial step for every engineering project, but one
						that my team actually ran into some trouble with. One of the hardest
						parts of engineering challenges like this, in my opinion, is knowing
						when to stop. An idea can be thought over, designed, redesigned,
						overdesigned, scrapped and reworked before anything is finalized.
						When this happens, you start to use valuable time inefficiently.
						I would say that one of the biggest challenges that we as a team faced
						was understanding when it was time to start manufacturing the ideas
						that we had so painstakingly created. Throwing those first chips
						was the hardest part. Now, we've started manufacturing lots of parts,
						and the ROV is coming together nicely.

			</div>
					<h4>Manufacturing</h4>
				<div class="row">
				<div class="description col-sm-4">

					<p>Manufacturing the ROV has taught me tons that I don't think I would
						ever get the chance to learn in my classes. While starting in on the
						manufacturing of the ROV, I learned how to make proper drawings from
						solidworks models, a skill taught to me in my Engineering Graphics
						course, and honed through this project. Also, it has taught me about
						 proper fits and tolerances, and design for manufacturablity.
